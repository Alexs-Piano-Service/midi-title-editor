# Changelog

All notable changes to APS MIDI Prep Tool will be recorded here.

This project follows a practical changelog format inspired by Keep a Changelog,
with release sections grouped by version and date.

## [0.6.12] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- `Utilities > Bulk Extraction...` for extracting every file from every
  supported floppy image directly inside a selected folder. Per-image output
  folders can use image filenames or available `PIANODIR.FIL` album titles,
  with optional lossless E-SEQ-to-MIDI conversion during extraction. Conversion
  mode outputs MIDI in place of the original E-SEQ and omits `PIANODIR.FIL` and
  `MUSIC.DIR` by default; a separate default-off option can retain those source
  files alongside the MIDI conversions. A stable two-level progress window
  tracks both the full image set and files within the current image. Its
  controls, validation, progress, completion, failure, and cancellation text
  are included in all 12 supported languages.
- A default-off `File > Save Options > Create Album Subfolder for Save As
  Image` option that puts Save As Image output into the same catalog-number and
  album-title subfolder used by Save As folder exports. It covers image repacks,
  multi-image spill output, and Greaseweazle image preservation, with interface
  and completion text in all 12 supported languages.

### Fixed

- Direct USB floppy formatting now blocks raw images larger than the capacity
  reported by the selected drive, preventing attempts such as writing an IBM
  2.88M ED image to a 1.44M drive.
- Windows raw floppy short-write errors now report the image bytes completed,
  the requested and written chunk sizes, and likely disk-format or drive-capacity
  mismatches even when Windows supplies no error code.

## [0.6.11] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Second-tier Yamaha PSR-600 `.BLK` Page Memory recognition for floppy images,
  physical disks, folders, file-open, and drag-and-drop workflows, with
  best-effort conversion of each BLK to one Type 1 MIDI whose recorded Melody
  banks are separate tracks. Melody setups containing a second voice descriptor
  with the recurring `0x7F` flag also produce clearly questioned layer tracks
  for auditioning, with both raw descriptors preserved in MIDI metadata because
  the flag's meaning is not yet confirmed. Accompaniment, Conductor, Multi Pad,
  style, and other proprietary data remain preserved in the source `.BLK`
  files.
- Space-bar playback toggling in File Inspection, covering both rendered audio
  previews and direct MIDI output.
- Per-channel General MIDI instrument selectors in File Inspection, with the
  recorded/default instrument shown inline, grouped searchable choices, and
  live preview-only overrides for realtime SoundFont or direct MIDI output.
- A 5%-400% live preview-tempo control in File Inspection that preserves
  recorded tempo changes while keeping audio, direct MIDI, seeking, duration,
  and the piano-roll playhead synchronized.
- A `Render Song...` menu in File Inspection that exports the selected song or
  all loaded songs to WAV or MP3 with the current channel selection, channel
  levels, instrument overrides, tempo, SoundFont, and preview volume.

### Changed

- File Inspection now groups related playback controls, reflows short channel
  lists to avoid empty columns, and uses shorter contextual tooltips.
- `File > Save As Image...` now asks for image type and disk size even when
  already editing an image, and can repack the current image contents into the
  newly selected disk size when needed.
- The Read Floppy option `Convert E-SEQ files to MIDI after reading` now starts
  unchecked for new users while still remembering the user's last accepted
  choice.

### Fixed

- File Inspection channel checkboxes now mute and restore channels in place
  during realtime SoundFont or direct MIDI playback, retaining the current
  song position instead of stopping, rebuilding, and returning to the start.
- File Inspection now marks channel controls with the same distinct 16-color
  palette used by piano-roll notes, so the channel list also serves as a
  legend.
- Realtime SoundFont preview now rebases its temporary MIDI tempo so the full
  5%-400% range stays inside FluidSynth's safe live-multiplier range. A tempo
  selected before pressing Play is also sent as the first live command,
  ensuring it takes effect without a restart.
- File Inspection SoundFont playback now keeps a realtime FluidSynth process
  active for tempo, instrument, and volume changes instead of replacing a
  rendered WAV. This prevents delayed jumps to 0:00 and avoids the pops and
  jitter caused by background rendering and playback-rate source swaps.
- File Inspection now initializes live program tracking before opening, and
  configures FluidSynth before its first note instead of stopping and
  restarting it after launch, preventing the dialog crash and silent previews.
- `File > Save As Image...` no longer skips the image-format and disk-size
  prompt when used again while already in Image Mode.
- HFE exports for IBM/Yamaha disk formats now normalize the HFE header metadata
  used by Nalbantov/HxC-style emulators, avoiding `0xFF` unknown
  encoding/interface values that could make some Disklaviers report
  "Unformatted Disk" even when the virtual disk contained files.

## [0.6.10] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `File > Save As ZIP...` for exporting the current listed files as a single ZIP archive while leaving originals untouched.
- Help menu feedback submission through the same signed support-report channel, using the `feedback.php` endpoint.
- Settings menu font-size choices for regular, small, and compact UI text.
- `Utilities > Apply Pedal Compatibility...` as a standalone MIDI utility for optional pedal compatibility transforms outside the E-SEQ conversion workflow.

### Changed

- About, welcome, Help disclaimer, and project documentation now include clearer
  lawful-use, non-affiliation, and third-party trademark notices.
- E-SEQ to MIDI exports include the short APS conversion text marker, but omit APS archival round-trip header metadata by default while still accepting older metadata when present.
- E-SEQ to MIDI and SMF1 to SMF0 conversions now preserve pedal channels by default. `Utilities > Apply Pedal Compatibility...` can stage conservative legacy Disklavier channel-3 pedal repair, binary pedal values, duplicate/stuck pedal cleanup, or Piano Roll Vector note-18 sustain markers for listed MIDI files.
- Pedal compatibility options now start unchecked every time so preservation remains the default behavior unless a user explicitly stages a transform.
- Portuguese locale aliases such as `pt-PT` now use the included Brazilian Portuguese translation set instead of falling back to English.

### Removed

- Removed the removable USB-stick formatting utility. USB floppy emulator media preparation is vendor- and firmware-specific, and APS MIDI Prep Tool no longer tries to choose or write a USB-stick layout.

### Fixed

- Catalog numbers can now fall back to catalog-shaped HFE filenames when `PIANODIR.FIL` contains only album-title metadata.
- The immediate post-read Greaseweazle image-save flow now fills a blank Catalog Number field from the saved HFE filename.
- Linux builds now prefer the PNG application icon, avoiding a brief low-quality icon flash during startup.
- Drag-and-drop import highlighting now fills the entire file list, and font-size changes also scale the main window spacing, margins, row heights, and fixed controls.
- Save As ZIP dialog, progress, success, and failure text now has shared translation coverage for the supported UI languages.
- Image creation, image edits, floppy writes, and ZIP/Image temporary outputs now use ASCII-safe transient filenames so mtools and conversion tools can handle source or destination names containing accents, emoji, CJK text, and shell-sensitive punctuation.
- Missing source-file errors now show a localized, user-friendly message that asks users to confirm files still exist, external drives or cloud-synced folders are available, and moved or renamed sources have been reopened.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- View menu with `Long title warning`, `Format for Disklavier screen`, `Hide Status`, `Hide Quick Panel`, `Hide Album Info`, and `View Logs...`.
- Live console log window with realtime stdout/stderr capture, search, pause, follow, copy, save, and clear controls.
- Disk menu that groups floppy/image media actions: `Read Floppy...`, `Image Floppy...`, `Save To Floppy...`, `Write Current Image to Floppy...`, recovery, and format tools.
- File menu submenus for `Save Options` and `Write Protection`, including `Create Album Subfolder`, `Back up before Saving`, `Write-Protect Original`, tag sidecars, and metadata summaries.
- Default keyboard shortcuts for the current File, Disk, View, Utilities, Settings, and Help menu commands.
- Optional `Do not show this dialog again` choice for Save As Image completion messages.
- `Trim Title Spaces` utility and hotkey, plus a Read Floppy option to clean Disklavier-spaced titles after normal or Greaseweazle reads.
- `Help > Report a Bug...` action with a support-report dialog that sends app context and optional recent console output.
- `Report A Bug...` button on unexpected operation-failure dialogs, prefilled with the error message and recent logs enabled.
- Empty file-list overlay text plus drag-hover highlighting for supported file drops.
- Bulgarian language support across the language selector, menus, dialogs, common workflows, and fallback catalog coverage.
- SoundFont picker and manager in File Inspection for choosing local SoundFonts or downloading SoundFonts from the app's online catalog, including recommended/category details and automatic unpacking for common archives.
- `Utilities > Render Audio...` batch renderer for exporting all listed MIDI or E-SEQ files as WAV or MP3 using a selected SoundFont.

### Changed

- Welcome workflows and README guidance now reflect the current menu labels and safety options.
- Menus were reorganized so File focuses on source/save behavior, Disk focuses on floppy and media operations, and Utilities focuses on inspection and batch conversion tools.
- Album Title and Catalog Number remain visible by default for Save As album-folder workflows, can be hidden from View, and refresh or blank when a disk is read.
- `Create Album Subfolder` is treated as part of the Album Info panel in the quick panel, and Save As now states whether it used the album subfolder or saved directly in the selected folder.
- Save As folder-export language now clarifies that album subfolders never affect Save As Image or floppy writes.
- Image and floppy save confirmation wording now describes renamed files as updates rather than removals.
- Write-protect wording is consistently hyphenated as `Write-Protect Original`.
- SoundFont dropdowns now use catalog names and clearer format/source labels instead of filename-derived labels when possible.

### Fixed

- Save warnings shown during a single-file image rename no longer imply the file is being removed.
- New log-window and save-confirmation dialog text now participates in the language catalog.
- Greaseweazle sector maps now mark a blank first sector as possible Yamaha copy protection instead of reporting it as damage that needs attention.
- Archival Greaseweazle reads now show one logical read sector-map dialog after the raw capture conversion.
- Greaseweazle progress now stays determinate when a blank first sector produces extra status output.
- App-owned dialogs and progress windows now recenter on the APS MIDI Prep Tool window when shown.
- Greaseweazle read sector-map dialog text is now shorter, with a localized compact color legend.
- Greaseweazle sector-map dialogs now show a polished visual legend with colored markers.
- Opening a saved Greaseweazle read no longer shows a second conversion sector-map dialog after the read map.
- Greaseweazle retry chatter now renders as a steady progress message instead of rapidly changing dialog text.
- Greaseweazle first-track possible Yamaha copy-protection progress now stays stable while sector retries are reported.
- Greaseweazle image-save defaults now use the disk catalog number, stripped to filename-safe letters and numbers, when available.
- The Greaseweazle read progress dialog now explicitly shows and recenters after its first progress updates.
- Save As Image no longer shows a Greaseweazle conversion sector map after a Greaseweazle disk read.
- Greaseweazle read sector maps now show after a disk read when available, with the existing `Do not show` preference still available.
- Save As Image now keeps progress visible while reopening a newly saved HFE or other converted image, avoiding a blank apparent hang after export.
- The immediate post-read Greaseweazle HFE save now writes the just-read capture directly instead of applying repairs or staged title edits meant for a later explicit Save As Image.
- Modal dialogs and progress windows now recenter when their contents resize, including Greaseweazle read messages and possible Yamaha copy-protection notes.
- Album Title and Catalog Number now remain populated when saving/exporting a disk session switches the app back to MIDI Mode.
- `Trim Title Spaces` now refreshes immediately after manual title edits, and the Disklavier screen title editor now shows the existing 16-character title lines directly without adding automatic padding.
- Drag-and-drop now accepts Windows file drags without pre-sniffing paths, contains path/probing failures during drop processing, and closes the Adding Files dialog cleanly instead of hanging.
- View Logs now uses Python stream capture on Windows instead of descriptor-level capture, improving reliability for PowerShell/Qt error output.
- Folder/file importing now skips unreadable Windows paths during probing instead of aborting the whole import.
- Formatting a USB floppy now reuses an already matching IBM FAT format when possible, clearing files and adding an empty `PIANODIR.FIL` for E-SEQ without rewriting the whole disk.
- The drag-and-drop overlay now keeps the supported-file subtitle consistent while files are being dragged.
- The drag-and-drop overlay subtitle and dashed outline now use higher-contrast colors for better Windows theme visibility.
- Blank or unformatted HFE images are now identified after the first matching conversion attempt, with a clear blank-image message instead of trying every disk geometry and offering recovery.
- Logs now use consistent timestamped, human-readable entries and include high-level app events for folder/image/floppy reads, saves, conversions, drag/drop, bug reports, settings changes, warnings, and failures.
- Release bundles no longer include FluidSynth by default, while AppImage and Windows release builds include LAME for MP3 export when available.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Apache License 2.0 project license, NOTICE file, security policy, and contribution guide.
- Optional `.tags.txt` ID3 sidecar file writing for local folder saves.
- Help menu disclaimer covering backups, lawful use, copyright, and risk.
- Integrated flow for recovering damaged physical floppy disks, matching damaged image recovery.
- File menu entries for Open MIDI Folder, Open Image, and Read Floppy, matching the main window buttons.
- File menu option for imaging a physical floppy directly to IMG or SCP without opening or scanning the disk contents.
- Utility for formatting removable USB sticks as FAT32 superfloppies for Yamaha E3/ENSPIRE Disklaviers or as MBR single-partition FAT32 disks for PianoForce, with device preview and destructive-action warnings.
- File menu option to create `metadata_summary.txt` on save, listing saved MIDI files and their detected metadata.
- Greaseweazle sector-map PNG previews after successful Greaseweazle reads, writes, and image conversions, with separate hide preferences for each transaction type; routine HFE-to-IMG opening skips the preview.
- HFE image opening now prefers 720K conversion for roughly 2 MB HFE files and 1.44M conversion for roughly 4 MB HFE files before trying other formats.
- Greaseweazle image-only conversion can recognize Macintosh 800K GCR/HFS SCP captures and save decoded IMG files without trying to open them as Yamaha FAT disks.
- Akai MPC `.ALL` sequence extraction from dropped files, opened files, disk images, and selected folders.
- Yamaha V50/SY77 sequence extraction when the V50/SY77 signature is present.
- Yamaha Electone MDR disk reading, including `.VFD` raw images and MDR images with blank or nonstandard boot sectors, plus `.EVT` performance conversion to Standard MIDI.
- Yamaha Clavinova/CVP E-SEQ support for `MUSIC.DIR` directories and `.MDA` song files, including MIDI conversion and Clavinova-aware floppy/image modes.
- Centralized localized message catalog with language selection, translated common dialogs, and reusable guidance for Greaseweazle, permission, write-protection, disk-full, unsupported-image, FAT/boot-sector, and cancellation errors.
- Settings menu with language selection, System/Light/Dark appearance options, and a reset action for hidden warning, confirmation, update-reminder, and Greaseweazle sector-map dialogs.

### Changed

- Repositioned documentation around Disklavier preservation and preparation workflows.
- Clarified the app's broader format direction: Disklavier preparation remains the
  primary purpose, while the tool is gaining basic understanding of related floppy
  formats that regularly appear in preservation work, including other Yamaha
  E-SEQ variants, V50/SY77 sequence disks, Electone MDR disks, and Akai MPC media.
- Updated direct floppy drive wording so internal drives are represented accurately.
- Reviewed onboarding and E-SEQ reference documentation against current app behavior.
- Expanded the E-SEQ reference with Clavinova/CVP `.MDA` and `MUSIC.DIR` findings.
- Moved tag sidecar writing into the File menu as a save behavior.
- Consolidated normal floppy reads and floppy recovery into a single Read Floppy dialog with Floppy Drive and Greaseweazle options.

### Fixed

- Recovery mode now continues scanning partially converted Greaseweazle images when conversion reports bad sectors, especially when the user selected an explicit disk format.
- Damaged image recovery now shows the Greaseweazle good/bad sector-map preview when recovery succeeds with bad or missing sectors.
- Disk recovery dialogs now remember the last recovery mode and selected recovery disk formats.
- Save As and Save As Image now reopen in the last successful save destination.
- Greaseweazle sector-map hide choices are reset again so recovery sector charts are not accidentally suppressed.
- Recovery now shows available Greaseweazle sector maps even when all sectors converted cleanly, and reports when a raw image has no sector map to chart.
- Each disk recovery run now resets sector-map duplicate tracking so repeated recoveries can show their chart again.
- Recovery Complete and E-SEQ to MIDI conversion confirmation dialogs now include hide-this-dialog checkboxes.
- Macintosh 800K SCP detection now runs only after IBM/Yamaha conversions fail with zero readable sectors, avoiding eager Mac probing for damaged Yamaha captures.
- Direct Windows floppy writes no longer report false failures when a VM or floppy device rejects the final flush after writing completes.
- Bundled console tools launched from the GUI no longer flash black console windows on Windows.
- File-level floppy saves now leave already-matching files in place instead of deleting and copying them again, while always refreshing generated E-SEQ directory files.
- File-level floppy saves on Windows now delete old files through the mounted drive and copy final files from the temp image with mtools extended host paths, avoiding false permission-denied failures on USB and VM floppy drives.
- Windows hidden volume metadata is hidden from floppy/image listings and no longer disables fast file-level floppy reads.
- Fast floppy reads no longer fall back to full-image reads just because an otherwise readable disk has an unreadable Yamaha/protection sector in file data.
- Fast floppy reads now reconstruct readable FAT/root data from redundant sectors and stop with the recovery prompt, rather than silently starting a slow full-disk read, after a Yamaha/FAT disk has already been recognized.
- Cancelled disk reads, image conversions, Greaseweazle operations, and recovery attempts now report as cancellation instead of surfacing command or conversion errors.
