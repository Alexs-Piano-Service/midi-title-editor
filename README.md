# APS MIDI Prep Tool

APS MIDI Prep Tool is a modern Disklavier preservation and preparation
workstation for MIDI files, Yamaha E-SEQ files, floppy images, and physical
floppy disks.

Current version: `0.6.10`

Author: Alexander Peppe

Company: Alex's Piano Service LLC

Address: 432 Elm St., Biddeford, ME 04005

The tool is built around practical Disklavier workflows: preserving old Yamaha
floppies, preparing Nalbantov emulator images, correcting song titles, converting
between MIDI and E-SEQ, making SMF0-compatible files, and inspecting songs
before you write anything back.

## What It Does

- Opens MIDI folders, Yamaha E-SEQ folders, floppy images, and physical floppies.
- Reads common floppy-image formats supported through Greaseweazle conversion,
  including IMG/BIN-style raw images and HFE workflows.
- Reads and writes physical floppies using a normal floppy drive or Greaseweazle.
- Shows Greaseweazle sector-map previews after reads, writes, and image conversions
  so good and bad sector positions can be reviewed visually.
- Images physical floppies directly to IMG or SCP files without opening or
  scanning the disk contents afterward.
- Recognizes Macintosh 800K GCR/HFS Greaseweazle SCP captures as non-Yamaha
  disks and can save decoded IMG copies without opening them for editing.
- Creates fresh floppy images, including default PianoSoft-style 720K E-SEQ images.
- Formats Yamaha Disklavier floppies as MIDI or E-SEQ disks.
- Recovers damaged floppy images and physical floppies with repair and raw-carving paths.
- Edits MIDI titles, E-SEQ titles, image filenames, and Disklavier album metadata.
- Trims Disklavier-spaced title text into regular MIDI titles during floppy reads
  or as a batch utility.
- Converts MIDI Type 1 / SMF1 files to MIDI Type 0 / SMF0.
- Converts Yamaha E-SEQ `.FIL` files to standard MIDI.
- Extracts Akai MPC `.SEQ` files and embedded sequences in MPC `.ALL` files,
  converting them to standard MIDI.
- Extracts Yamaha V50/SY77 NSEQ sequences when the V50/SY77 signature is
  present, converting them to standard MIDI.
- Reads Yamaha Electone MDR floppy images, including some images with blank or
  nonstandard boot sectors, and converts `.EVT` performance files to standard
  MIDI while preserving millisecond timing and SysEx events.
- Converts MIDI to Yamaha E-SEQ, converting Type 1 MIDI to Type 0 first when needed.
- Generates and refreshes `PIANODIR.FIL` for Yamaha E-SEQ disks and folders.
- Stages destructive or format-changing work until you choose `File > Save`,
  `File > Save As...`, `File > Save As ZIP...`, `File > Save As Image...`, or
  `Disk > Write Current Image to Floppy...`.
- `File > Save As Image...` asks for output image type and disk size each time,
  including from Image Mode, and can split or repack files into numbered images
  when the selected disk size is too small.
- Can write a `metadata_summary.txt` file on save with each saved MIDI file and
  its detected MIDI metadata.
- Keeps save behavior in `File > Save Options`, including album subfolders,
  backups, tag sidecars, and metadata summaries.
- Protects original images and floppies with
  `File > Write Protection > Write-Protect Original`.
- Shows song lists, file inspection metadata, piano-roll previews, channels, and
  playback previews, with a SoundFont picker and manager for optional
  downloadable SoundFonts.
- Renders all currently listed MIDI or E-SEQ files to WAV or MP3 from
  `Utilities > Render Audio...` using a selected SoundFont.
- Provides a `View` menu for title-warning display, Disklavier title formatting,
  status visibility, quick-panel visibility, album-info visibility, and realtime
  console logs.
- Shows an empty-list drop target and highlights the file list during supported
  file drags so MIDI, E-SEQ, and disk-image files are easier to add.
- Provides `Help > Send Feedback...` and `Help > Report a Bug...` for sending
  feedback or support reports with app details and optional recent, timestamped
  console logs.
- Provides `Settings > Font Size` choices for regular, small, and compact UI
  text.
- Provides customizable keyboard shortcuts for current File, Disk, View,
  Utilities, Settings, and Help commands.
- Includes localized UI support for English, Spanish, French, German, Italian,
  Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Dutch, Polish, Japanese, Korean, and
  Simplified Chinese.
- Optionally writes `.tags.txt` ID3 sidecar files for local folder exports.

## Common Workflows

### Preserve A Yamaha Floppy

1. Insert the disk. If your operating system asks to format it, cancel.
2. Choose `Disk > Read Floppy...`.
3. Select `Floppy Drive` or `Greaseweazle`.
4. Optionally enable `Trim title spaces after reading` to clean centered
   Disklavier-screen titles into regular MIDI titles.
5. Review the files, titles, types, and free space.
6. Use `File > Save As Image...` to create an archival image, or
   `File > Save As...` to extract files.

For difficult disks, choose `Disk > Read Floppy...` and enable
`Start in recovery mode`. Recovery asks for the disk size, defaults to the
common Yamaha 720K DD format, copies a full image first, then tries filesystem
repair and raw MIDI/E-SEQ carving.

To make a preservation copy without opening the disk contents in the app, choose
`Disk > Image Floppy...` and save an IMG sector image or Greaseweazle SCP flux
capture.

### Save Safely

`File > Write Protection > Write-Protect Original` keeps `File > Save` from
overwriting the current image or floppy until you explicitly turn that
protection off. `File > Save As...` and `File > Save As Image...` remain
available for copy-based work. Use `File > Save As ZIP...` when you want the
current listed files packaged into one archive without overwriting originals.

Enable `File > Save Options > Back up before Saving` when you want APS MIDI
Prep Tool to create a backup before overwriting local files or disk images.

Enable `File > Save Options > Create Album Subfolder` when exporting Yamaha
E-SEQ files with `File > Save As...` and you want the destination folder
grouped by the current album title and catalog number. Save As confirms whether
it used an album subfolder or saved directly in the selected folder. This option
does not affect `File > Save As Image...` or floppy writes.

### Prepare A Nalbantov USB Stick Image

1. Open an existing HFE image with `File > Open > Open Image...`, or use
   `File > New Image...`.
2. Use the default 720K E-SEQ image settings for PianoSoft-style disks.
3. Drag MIDI or E-SEQ files into the table.
4. In E-SEQ image mode, dropped MIDI files are staged as E-SEQ conversions.
5. Edit titles and order as needed.
6. Use `File > Save As Image...` and choose HFE output and the intended disk
   size.

Copy the finished HFE file to the USB stick prepared for the Nalbantov
emulator. If you are preparing replacement USB media, keep the setup and
configuration files from the original Nalbantov USB stick and use Nalbantov's
instructions or software; formatting a blank stick by itself is not enough.
HFE exports for IBM/Yamaha disk formats are written with Nalbantov/HxC-style
IBM PC header metadata for better emulator compatibility.

### Convert MIDI Type 1 To Type 0

1. Open a MIDI folder or drag MIDI files into the window.
2. Check the `Type` column.
3. Choose `Utilities > Convert > Convert All SMF1 to SMF0`.
4. Review the staged changes.
5. Use `Save` to overwrite originals, or `Save As` to write copies.

The conversion is staged first. Original files are not modified until you save.
Pedal channels are preserved by default.

### Apply Pedal Compatibility To MIDI Files

Choose `Utilities > Apply Pedal Compatibility...` when you need an explicit
compatibility transform on listed MIDI files. The utility stages changes for
save, so originals are not modified until you use `Save`, `Save As`, or save
the current image/floppy session. Available transforms include repairing
controller-only legacy Disklavier channel-3 pedal lanes, converting pedal
controllers to on/off values, cleaning duplicate or stuck pedal events, and
adding Piano Roll Vector note-18 sustain markers. All options start unchecked
because binary values and cleanup can remove half-pedal or archival detail.

### Convert Between MIDI And E-SEQ

- In MIDI mode, dropped E-SEQ files are staged as MIDI conversions.
- In E-SEQ mode, dropped MIDI files are staged as E-SEQ conversions.
- In E-SEQ image or floppy modes, dropped MIDI files are staged as E-SEQ and
  converted through Type 0 first when necessary.
- E-SEQ to MIDI exports include a short APS conversion text marker, but omit
  the large APS archival round-trip header metadata by default so the Standard
  MIDI files stay compatible with Yamaha hardware. The converter still reads
  older APS metadata when present.
- E-SEQ to MIDI exports preserve pedal channels and controller values by
  default. Optional pedal compatibility transforms are a separate MIDI utility
  under `Utilities > Apply Pedal Compatibility...`.
- `PIANODIR.FIL` is generated or refreshed on save when needed.
- `File > Save Options > Create Album Subfolder` controls whether folder
  exports use the current album title and catalog number for a subfolder.
  Image saves and floppy writes always use the path or device you choose.

### Inspect A Song

Use `Utilities > File Inspection...`, or double-click a song's `Type` field.
The inspection window shows a piano roll, metadata, tracks, channels, controller
notes, selectable channels, position control, and playback preview.

### Make A Copyable Song List

Use `Utilities > Song List...` to create a clean copyable list of the current
album and songs. Extra spaces in Disklavier-centered titles are collapsed for
readable reference lists.

Use `Utilities > Trim Title Spaces` to stage that same cleanup for the listed
MIDI or E-SEQ titles before saving.

### Create Tag Sidecar Files

Enable `File > Save Options > Create Tag Sidecars When Saving` before saving
local folder files. When enabled, APS MIDI Prep Tool writes one UTF-8
`.tags.txt` file next to each saved MIDI or E-SEQ file. These sidecars use
four-letter ID3 tag keys such as `TIT2` for title and `TALB` for album.

Tag sidecar files are not written when saving in Image Mode or Floppy Mode.

### View Logs And Shortcuts

`View > Hide Status` is checked by default and hides the status text beneath the
file list. `View > Hide Quick Panel` hides the Options, Utilities, and File
Actions panel when you want more table space. `View > Hide Album Info` hides
the Album Info panel, including Album Title, Catalog Number, and Create Album
Subfolder. When visible, these fields stay available so Save As and
album-folder options can use the current disk metadata.

Use `View > View Logs...` to open a live console-output window for the current
session. It is useful when checking Greaseweazle, mtools, format, or conversion
output while the app is still running. The log now includes readable app events
for major actions such as opening folders and images, reading floppies,
saving, drag-and-drop imports, feedback, bug reports, warnings, and failures.

Use `Help > Report a Bug...` to send a bug report. The dialog can include an
optional sender email and a recent section of the live console log along with
app and operating-system details. Unexpected operation-failure dialogs may also
offer `Report This Bug...`, which opens the same report form with the error
details already filled in.

Use `Help > Send Feedback...` to send suggestions, workflow notes, or other
general feedback through the same signed support channel.

Use `Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts...` to review or customize the default
hotkeys for all current File, Disk, View, Utilities, Settings, and Help menu
commands.

### SoundFonts And Audio Rendering

Use `Utilities > File Inspection...` to inspect a file, preview it, choose the
SoundFont used for FluidSynth previews, and open `Download SoundFonts...` when
you want additional SoundFonts. Use `Utilities > Render Audio...` to
batch-render every currently listed MIDI or E-SEQ file through a selected
SoundFont.

SoundFont preview and WAV rendering require FluidSynth installed on the system
or supplied through `APS_MIDI_PREP_FLUIDSYNTH`. MP3 rendering first creates a
temporary WAV and then uses LAME for the final encoded file. Release packages
bundle LAME when available; source runs can use LAME on `PATH` or a path supplied
through `APS_MIDI_PREP_LAME`.

The online SoundFont manager reads this JSON manifest by default:

```text
https://www.alexanderpeppe.com/aps-midi-prep-tool-data/soundfonts.json
```

The manifest uses `schema_version`, `updated`, and a `soundfonts` list. Entries
can include `name`, `subtitle`, `category`, `format`, `recommended`,
`default_for`, `download_url`, `homepage_url`, `license`, `license_url`,
`approx_size`, `attribution`, and `notes`. Direct `.sf2` and `.sf3` downloads
install directly; common `zip` and `tar.*` archives are unpacked automatically.
Set `APS_MIDI_PREP_SOUNDFONT_CATALOG_URL` to test a different manifest.

## Modes

### MIDI Mode

Use this for normal `.mid` or `.midi` folders. You can edit titles, rename files
to DOS 8.3, convert SMF1 to SMF0, and save in place or to a new folder.

### E-SEQ Mode

Use this for local Yamaha `.FIL` files and local `PIANODIR.FIL` workflows. The
tool manages the special PIANODIR row separately and can preserve or refresh
album metadata.

### Image Mode

Use this for floppy images. You can stage adds, removals, renames, title edits,
MIDI/E-SEQ conversions, and image exports without modifying the original image
until you save.

### Floppy Mode

Use this after reading or formatting a physical floppy. Save operations can write
back to the same device when explicitly allowed, or you can export to a folder or
image first.

## Requirements

For normal source runs:

- Python 3.10+
- PySide6
- `mtools` for image authoring and FAT image operations
- Greaseweazle CLI (`gw`) for Greaseweazle reads, writes, and conversions
- FluidSynth for SoundFont-based File Inspection previews and WAV rendering
- A redistributable GM/piano SoundFont for SoundFont previews and audio rendering
- LAME for MP3 audio rendering
- Device permissions for direct floppy drive reads and writes

Release AppImages bundle the needed `mtools` commands, Greaseweazle CLI, 7-Zip,
and LAME when available, but do not bundle FluidSynth by default. Windows
release builds bundle LAME for MP3 export. Physical floppy access still depends
on operating-system device permissions.

## Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install PySide6
python3 aps_midi_prep_tool.py
```

## Update Checks

`Help -> Check for Updates...` reads this public JSON URL:

```text
https://www.alexanderpeppe.com/aps-midi-prep-tool-data/update.json
```

Startup update checks are enabled by default and can be disabled from the Help
menu or from the startup update notice.
