# APS MIDI Manager

`APS MIDI Manager` is a desktop tool for editing MIDI track titles with legacy playback systems in mind.

Built for the workflows at [AlexanderPeppe.com](https://www.alexanderpeppe.com/), this project helps players, technicians, and collectors keep MIDI files named properly and compatible with older Disklavier setups.

## Why This Exists

Many older systems are sensitive to modern filenames and metadata. This app focuses on practical compatibility tasks:

- Edit MIDI titles quickly in bulk
- Keep track names safer for older hardware
- Rename files to DOS 8.3 format when needed
- Create backups before making changes
- Leaving XG data intact

## Features

- Load all `.mid` / `.midi` files from a folder
- Drag and drop MIDI files into the table
- Click titles to edit and queue changes
- Optional warning for titles longer than 32 characters
- Save updates directly to source files
- `Save As...` to write updated copies to another folder
- One-click `Rename All to DOS 8.3`
- Optional backup files (`*_backup.mid`) before changes

## Legacy Disklavier Notes

For older Disklavier and floppy-disk style workflows, these practices are usually safest:

- Use short titles
- Prefer printable ASCII characters
- Use DOS 8.3 filenames when exchanging files with legacy media or software
- Keep backups before large renaming operations

This app includes tools for all of the above.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `PySide6`

### Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install PySide6
python3 midi_title_editor.py
```

## Basic Workflow

1. Launch the app.
2. Click **Choose MIDI Folder**.
3. Review file names and extracted titles.
4. Click the **Title** column to edit entries.
5. Use **Save** to write changes, or **Save As...** for copies.
6. Use **Rename All to DOS 8.3** when targeting legacy systems.
